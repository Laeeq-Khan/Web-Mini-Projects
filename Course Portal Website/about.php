<strong><u>Welcome to University of Sargodha</u> </strong><br><br>

We are proud to introduce the University of Sargodha, which started its journey in 1929 with the establishment of De’Montmorency College, later renamed in 1946 as Government College Sargodha; which was awarded university charter in 2002. Since then, the University has emerged as one of Pakistan's leading seats of advanced studies and research in various disciplines of business and economics, arts and humanities, natural and social sciences, law, agriculture, pharmacy, medical and health sciences, engineering and technology.

With its main campus located in Sargodha city and two subcampuses at Bhakkar and Mianwali, the University currently has 25,976 students and 657 faculty members, including 279 PhDs, in 31 Departments, four Constituent Colleges and eight Faculties. There are also five public-private partnership campuses in Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala and Mandi Bahauddin as well as over 200 affiliated colleges spread across the province of Punjab (with additional faculty and students).
<br><br>
The University offers modern teaching, research and lodging facilities to its students and scholars, including wellequipped classrooms and research labs, rich library resources with online access to books and journals, as well as a secure and serene environment for sports and cocurricular activities. With an affordable fee structure, it provides a host of scholarships, internships and business opportunities to deserving and competitive students.
