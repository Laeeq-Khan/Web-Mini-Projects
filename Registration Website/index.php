    <p>It is a matter of pride and privilege for me to state that the Campus has successfully entered into its 5th year. Most of the infrastructure of the campus has been completed. A new academic block has been completed, which contains class rooms, laboratories, seminar rooms, library and faculty offices. A girls hostel, faculty hostel and a mosque would be completed soon. During the last four years, the Sub Campus Mianwali has made tremendous progress both in academic and co-curricular activities with the dedication and hard work of the faculty. Currently, more than 3500 students have been enrolled and the campus is offering 22 various programs at graduate and master's level. I am confident, in the coming years, we, as a team of highly dedicated personnel, will open up new vistas and avenues in the field of education and research. We strive every nerves and muscles to transform the Campus into the highest seat of learning. My prime focus would be on academic excellence, research and innovation. My team is committed to maintain its distinction in imparting quality education, learning, research and other academic activities. We plan to expand academic activity by launching more programs in new disciplines. The Campus hosts a unique community of students and staff dedicated to exhibit the best possible. Our aim is to provide conducive environment for pedagogy, research and public services. I warmly welcome you for your new journey of life. Here, at the Campus, we would try to add new colours to your life.</p>
